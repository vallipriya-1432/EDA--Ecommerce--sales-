# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis

This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project where I worked with an e-commerce sales dataset covering the years **2015–2018**.  
The goal was to understand how sales vary over time, across regions, and between different types of customers and products.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

I used Python and Google Colab to clean the data, explore patterns, and create visualizations that tell a clear story about the business.  
The analysis focuses on four main areas:

1. **Sales Trends:** How sales change over months and years  
2. **Regional & Customer Insights:** Which regions and customer segments perform best  
3. **Category Insights:** What kinds of products generate the most revenue  
4. **Operational Insights:** How shipping time affects performance

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** – for all the analysis  
- **Pandas** – data cleaning and preparation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – creating charts and visualizations  
- **Google Colab** – writing and running the notebook

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- Sales grew steadily from **2015 to 2018**, with clear spikes during the **end-of-year holiday season**.  
- The **West region** generated the highest revenue, while the **Central region** was weaker.  
- The **Consumer segment** accounted for most of the sales.  
- **Technology** and **Furniture** were the top-performing categories.  
- Most orders shipped within **2–4 days**, and longer shipping times slightly reduced sales.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Focus marketing campaigns during **Q4 (October–December)** to take advantage of holiday sales.  
- Improve logistics and marketing in the **Central region**.  
- Offer loyalty or bulk-purchase discounts for **Corporate** customers.  
- Keep promoting **Technology** products since they have strong revenue potential.  
- Maintain fast shipping — customers clearly value quick delivery.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
- Cleaning and transforming real-world data  
- Using Pandas for analysis and Seaborn for visualization  
- Finding insights that connect data to business strategy  
- Presenting analysis clearly in a notebook format

## 🚀 Next Steps

In the future, I’d like to:
- Add a **profit and discount analysis**  
- Create a **dashboard** in Power BI or Tableau  
- Try a simple **sales forecast model** using time-series techniques
